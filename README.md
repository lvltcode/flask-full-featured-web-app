## Ideas (simple one)
Build a full-features blog that User can register, sign in, customize their profile (pictures, name, email, change password), post blog with pictures, text, date created etc.

I intended to use Python/Flask/HTML/CSS/SQLite first, then later connect to JS/ReactJS if need more challenges to add more decorators, interactive effects.

## User Stories
- [x] User can use their email and set a new account via Form Input
Demo:

- [ ] User maybe forgot their password, so they need to reset their password successfully.
- [ ] The reset email send to user's email and they can access to change new password
- [x] When client's side throw a error page, user can see the 404 page or some page that they can understand what happened.
- [x] The latest post will appear on the first page

## Language, library tools I intend to use:
* `HTMl/CSS/Bootstrap/Font Awesome`.
* `Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-migrates, Blueprints, Flask-wtf, flask-bscrypt`
* `Heroku`
* `Python`
* `JS/React.js` (*not sure to implement these*)
* `SQL/Postgres`
